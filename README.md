# Tangram-Man
Tangram Man HTML/CSS Project

This is a project to create a tangram man using HTML and CSS. The tangram man is a classic Chinese puzzle that involves creating different shapes using seven pieces: two large right-angled triangles, one medium right-angled triangle, two small right-angled triangles, one square, and one parallelogram. The tangram man is a popular tangram puzzle that involves using all seven pieces to create a man-like shape.

In this project, I have created a tangram man using CSS properties, and have used Key frame animations to create different poses for the tangram man like Standing, Walking, Running and Sitting.
